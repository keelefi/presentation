# The History Of The Modern Computer

To build:

    $ pdflatex presentation.tex
    $ pdflatex presentation.tex

Note: The same command has to be run twice. The first run says like:

    Package rerunfilecheck Warning: File `presentation.out' has changed.
    (rerunfilecheck)                Rerun to get outlines right
    (rerunfilecheck)                or use package `bookmark'.
